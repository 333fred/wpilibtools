                 UDPEE

This program reads standard input and writes it (line buffered) to stardard output and via UDP to port 6666. It can optionally log its input to a file.

To install, cross-compile the program with the arm-none-linux-gnueabi-4.4.1 toolchain (you may need to adjust your $PATH) and ftp copy it to /home/admin/udpee_arm. Then edit /usr/local/frc/bin/frcRunRobot.sh and, in one of the last lines, replace

[... preceding code] > {logfile} 2>&1

with

[... preceding code] | /home/admin/udpee_arm broadcast {logfile} 2>&1

One small adjustment must be made to the robot code: because stdout and stderr are buffered in large chunks when the receiving end of the pipe is not a tty, packets are only sent when a new chunk is delivered. Adding the calls (from stdio.h)

   setlinebuf(stdin);
   setlinebuf(stdout);

somewhere in the robot initialization code should enable the helper utility to send every line as soon as it is written (std::cout << x << std::endl; flushes the buffer, so if you only use C++ style IO this adjustment is unnecessary).
